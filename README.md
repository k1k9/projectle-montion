# Projectle Montion
Calculating and drawing projectle montion based on user input. For now avaliable is only calculate projectle montion. All this script is based on [projectle montion on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectile_motion).

## To Do
- [ ] Allow user to input data directly from commandline 
- [ ] Draw projectle montion in Matplotlib

## Requrements
I been testing this script on WSL2 Ubuntu 20 and if you have error like this:
```UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure```
All you need to do is install tkinter or other graphic interface supported by Matplotlib. Example:
``` sudo apt install python3-tk```
